# Simple collaborative todos

Open the page and start creating to-dos, and your to-dos with others.

The goal of this project is to create a simple website where you can keep your own todos and share them with others too.

**No authentication/log-in required!**

Nothing will be stored on the server, everything will be stored in the shared link.

Feel free to create PR's if you have a nice idea, but please keep this project simple.

I don't want changes/improvements for this project to be hidden away from the public, so please keep your fork public too if you create any.

# Future improvements in no particular order

- Ability to edit to-dos
- Ability to remove to-dos
- Create server-less static "mode" to host this in Github pages, but that still works with shared links
- ~Keep to-dos in local storage~ and create a history page to show all to-dos in local storage
- ~Create an archive button to "throw away" all to-dos currently in view and to start with a clean slate~
- Create import and export button
- Add live collaboration and database persistence (+ update readme)
